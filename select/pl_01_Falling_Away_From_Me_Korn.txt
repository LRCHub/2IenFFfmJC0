[Chorus]
Beating me down!
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground!
Screaming some sound!
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground!
[Verse 2]
Falling away from me
It's spinning round and round
Falling away from me
It's lost and can't be found
Falling away from me
It's spinning round and round
Falling away from me
Throw it down
[Chorus]
Beating me down!
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground!
Screaming some sound!
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground!
[Bridge]
Twisting me!
They won't go away!
So I pray!
Go away!
